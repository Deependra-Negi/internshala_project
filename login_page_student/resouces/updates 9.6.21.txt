1.made the page nearly as similar as possible2.
2.changed bg img and illustrations as per the original website
3.recreated the form, now it's fully responsive and maintaining it's size and gaps.
4.applied some media queries (for different size laptops),made it responsive, now making it fully responsive(for mobiles and tabs) won't be difficult.
5.for feedback/testimonial carousel section, applied brand logos, now we can toggle them to change color(having some troubles with slider/carousel hence didn't implemented it yet, will do that later)
6. made some little changes to the header, and some changes to footer too, now it's nearly similar and responding to resizing


note- still having that bottom slider issue, i checked everything but don't know why its happening, it's not affecting much but will have to resolve.
